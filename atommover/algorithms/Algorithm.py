    """Parent class for all algorithms.


    NB: The following functions are placeholders for illustrative purposes only and
    should be overwritten for your particular algorithm.

    If your algorithm can only prepare select target configurations, please list them here.

    e.g:

    Supported configurations: Middle Fill (see `atommover.utils.core.Configurations`
    for a list of configurations).

        self, atom_array: AtomArray, do_ejection: bool = False
    ) -> tuple[np.ndarray, list, bool]:
        """
        This is the main function for the algorithm.

        It should take as input:
            1. an AtomArray object (which, btw, contains the initial
               configuration `atom_array.matrix` and the target configuration
               `atom_array.target`).
            2. an optional argument to run an ejection subroutine
               (see `atommover.algorithms.source.ejection.py` for the protocol).
            3. any other (optional!) kwargs you see fit to include :)

        It should provide as output:
            1. `config` (np.ndarray) - the final configuration after all moves have been applied
               (ideally, this should just be the target configuration)

            2. `move_list` (list of lists of `Move` objects) - contains all
               the moves to transform the initial configuration into the final configuration.
               Each list inside `move_list` is a set of moves that will be done in parallel.

               If you're confused by lists inside of lists, consider the following example:
               `move_list = [small_move_list, small_move_list1, small_move_list2]`
               `small_move_list = [Move1], small_move_list1 = [Move2, Move3], small_move_list2 =
               [Move4, Move5]`

               When this is read by the framework, it will first execute Move1, then will execute
               Move2 and Move3 in parallel, then after that Move4 and Move5 will be executed in
               parallel.

            3. `success_flag` (bool) - simple sanity check. This should be set to `True` if the
               algorithm prepares the final configuration and `False` if it does not. This is
               helpful during benchmarking.
        """
        config = np.zeros(atom_array.shape)
        move_list = []
        success_flag = False

        # your code here #

        return config, move_list, success_flag
